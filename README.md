# MediaMonksChallenge

The project contains the skeleton of a simple Albums List, Photos List, and Photo Details application; using data from: https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com

You need to complete it by fulfilling the issues you can find in this repository, and by adding any extra love you have.

There are no rules other than it should run (after running 'npm install') on iOS and Android, just make it cool and try to keep your commits clear!

You will be judged on things like architecture, readability, animation, git usage, design, performance, third-party usage and more.
